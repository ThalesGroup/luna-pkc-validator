## How To Contribute

For any contribution to this project, you should:

- Submit an issue describing your proposed contribution
- Wait for a feedback from the code owner and agree with him on the "what" and "how" to produce it
- Fork the repository, develop, test, review and santize your contribution
- Submit a pull request to have your contribution validated, integrated in the main branch and published.

Contributions must comply with a few good practices and common-sense rules to keep the code as readable and maintainable as possible.

The design and implementation can be challenged and modified, but with performances, efficiency and code quality in mind.

The existing code style and coding rules must be followed when fixing, modifying the existing code base.
